üìñ Documentation
Authentication
To create and manage tasks, users need to be authenticated. The app uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. When a user logs in, the server generates a JWT and sends it back to the client. The client then sends the JWT with each subsequent request to the server. If the JWT is valid, the server allows the request. If the JWT is invalid or missing, the server returns a 401 Unauthorized response.
